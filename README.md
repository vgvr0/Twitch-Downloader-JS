# Twitch-Downloader-JS

This Node.js script allows you to download videos from Twitch while also saving their title and description. By specifying the Twitch video ID and the desired output directory, the script utilizes the twitch-dl library to fetch the video's title and description. It then downloads the video and saves it to the specified directory with the appropriate file name format. 

It provides a convenient way to download Twitch videos while also keeping track of their associated metadata. Remember to respect Twitch's terms of service and any applicable copyright laws when using this script.
